  Originally from a small town in Massachusetts,  I spent the last five years teaching English and piano in Italy and Spain. I have always had a passion for trying new things, living in new places, and learning from and connecting to communities.

  My interest in programming arose during the lockdown after discovering some free online courses. I quickly realized how familiar coding seemed. I find that the process of putting code together is a very similar process to learning a language. Subsequently I took a full-stack software engineering bootcamp at The Flatiron school where I sharpened my programming skills. 
  
    With the skills I have harnessed over the years, I wish to use them to build connections, learn, and create for a better future.
